# Changelog

New, changed or removed capabilities, one line each, brief and direct. A release's section becomes its release notes.

## 1.5.1

- New: `prop:flow(event)` runs one of a prop's own flow events, such as a research sample's `on_picked_up`.
- Changed: the `freeze` effect keeps commands queued for frozen enemies intact, which stops a crash when enemies take damage while frozen and then resume.

## 1.5.0

- New: `api.lobby.share(name, value)` and `api.lobby.shared(name)` share short texts between machines.
- New: `api.world.to_screen(pos)` finds a point of the level on the screen.
- New: `api.world.prop(unit, pos, opts)` places a unit in the level on this machine only, with `move`, `scale` and `remove`.
- New: `api.ui.with_texts(texts, fn, ...)` runs a function with some of the game's text keys showing your words.
- Changed: `api.enemies.spawn(key, count, pos)` takes a position.
